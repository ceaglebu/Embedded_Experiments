# I2C
Experiments with I2C on ATmega328P

## Polling I2C Transmit
Proof of concept for using I2C (TWI) on ATmega328P. Uses polling and hardcoded data values.

## Interrupt I2C Transmit
Proof of concept for using Interrupts to handle I2C on ATmega328P. Created basic unoptimized interface for making data transmissions over the bus.
